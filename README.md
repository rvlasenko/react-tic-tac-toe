## Project Overview

This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React and a lightweight custom Redux implementation. The application features a responsive design with a dark theme, allowing players to take turns placing X and O marks on a 3Ã—3 grid.

## Architecture

### Custom Redux Implementation

The project uses a custom Redux implementation ([`redux-manager.js`](src/redux-manager.js)) instead of react-redux, providing:

- `useReduxState` - Custom hook to access the Redux store state
- `useDispatch` - Custom hook to dispatch actions
- `ReduxRenderer` - Component that initializes the Redux context

### Application Structure

The application follows a structured component hierarchy with separation of concerns:

#### Core Components

- [`Game`](src/components/Game/Game.jsx) - Controls game restart functionality
- [`Field`](src/components/Field/Field.jsx) - Handles game logic, winner calculation, and player interactions
- [`Information`](src/components/Information/Information.jsx) - Displays current game status

#### Presentational Components

Each core component has a corresponding layout component:

- [`GameLayout`](src/components/Game/GameLayout.jsx)
- [`FieldLayout`](src/components/Field/FieldLayout.jsx)
- [`InformationLayout`](src/components/Information/InformationLayout.jsx)

#### State Management

- Redux Store ([`store.js`](src/store.js))
- Action Types and Creators ([`actions.js`](src/actions.js))
- Reducer ([`reducer.js`](src/reducer.js))

## Features

- Turn-based gameplay between X and O players
- Automatic detection of winning combinations
